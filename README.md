⚠️ If your region supports official payment methods for **Cursor** and you can afford it, we encourage you to purchase directly from the official platform. **Cursor** is an excellent editor, and your support helps its development.

⚠️ This project is intended to provide a solution for regions where official payments are inconvenient. Each **Pro** account is shared across eight devices, and all accounts are purchased with our own personal funds. Please do not abuse this service. Thank you for your cooperation!

⚠️ The costs and benefits of using this project are the same as the official service. This project is not cheaper; it only appears so because costs are shared among eight users. However, note that the stability and speed are not as good as the official service.

⚠️The [**Proxy Mode**](/docs/proxyMode.md) is currently more stable than the standard mode. If you encounter resource issues in [**Proxy Mode**](/docs/proxyMode.md), please start a new session by restarting **cursor-vip**.

⚠️ We plan to collaborate with the official **Cursor** team in the future to support projects that contribute to global progress and innovation.
